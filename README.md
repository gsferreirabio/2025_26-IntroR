Data and scripts for the WS 2025/26 session of the Introduction to R course.

The site for the course can be accessed here: https://gsferreirabio.github.io/2025_6-IntroR This page is still incomplete, unfortunately, only the basic steps are online. So, for the moment, you can access the other scripts I used in the course on the scripts folder.
